# Capstone

This site is based of craigslist where purpose of the application is for people to buy and sell products to each other. Every user can can perform
crud (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on their products. 
This site has a tag system, where products can be tagged with labels and users can see related products with similar labels.
One fault of craiglist is there not much safety when it comes to meeting with the seller, this application tries to circumvent
that by providing anonymous reviews. The review are anonymous to provide privacy and safety of the reviewer.
